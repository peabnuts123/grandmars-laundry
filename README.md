# Hanging Out To Mars
## By Really Dangerous Games

This is our entry for the [Butterscotch Shenanijam 2017](https://itch.io/jam/bscotch100). It is the first game we've ever made/finished 😃🎉.

You can download pre-built versions of the game or play it in your browser over on [the itch.io page](https://peabnuts123.itch.io/grandmars-laundry) for the game.

We worked on this project using Unity Collaborate so the history from throughout the actual jam is not preserved in git. This project has been open sourced so we can use git for any changes going forward, and so that any others may learn from the project, we know we certainly did while making it! 

I have chucked a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution licence on it because reasons, if that doesn't work for you for whatever reason feel free to drop me a line [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peabnuts123) and we can work something out. 

## Contact
At the moment we don't have much public-facing content like a website or an official Twitter, but you can contact Jeff [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peabnuts123) if you need to reach out to us 🙏.

Hope you enjoy! 👍
